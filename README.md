qchat

The qchat client is a program that allows the user to chat over WAN with other clients.
It would serve as base protocol for future communication implementation of the Andromeda project.
Note, the Andromeda project is a code name for the universal wireless transmitter which would record/log data and send it off to a remote server. In short, the unidev development.
